The given library has 3 linear regression algorithms made.
Two of them are done using a gradient decent, while the 
analytical method is done by solving when the derivative of the
cost function equals 0. Run.sh can run the test file, or you can
type 'python3 tests.py'.

In order to use any of the regeression algorithms simple build them
using the train data frame, the attribute list, and the learning rate.
You can then test the built linear regression by using the function test
and input the test data frame. For the analytic regress you will not need
to input a learning rate.
